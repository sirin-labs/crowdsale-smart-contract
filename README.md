#### Refund Route - SRN tokens with guarantee

Investors can choose to buy SRN tokens with guarantee.

refund route rates are 50% of the regular rate (starting from 500 SRNs for 1 ETH at the first day and ending at 250 SRNs for 1 ETH at the last day of the crowd sale).

SRN tokens and the ETH funds are deposited to a RefundVault contract owned by the SirinCrowdsale contract.

Investors bought SRNs on the refund route can get refund of their ETH or claim their SRN tokens only after the crowd sale ends.

Refund ETH period is limited to 60 days after the crowd sale ends. SRN token claim is not limited in time.

Any of the actions (refund ETH and SRN token claim) can be executed by the investor directly on the RefundVault contract.

Any of the actions (refund ETH and SRN token claim) can be done on parts of the amount.

* In case of refund ETH, the proportional amount of SRN tokens will be burned.
* In case of SRN token claim, the proportional amount of ETH will be transferred to Sirin ETH Wallet.
* In Case of partial action the remaining ETH and SRN tokens will be available to more refund or claim actions according to the refund period and updated amounts.


## Develop

* Contracts are written in [Solidity][solidity] and tested using [Truffle][truffle] and [testrpc][testrpc].

* Our smart contract is based on [Open Zeppelin][openzeppelin] smart contracts [v1.3.0][openzeppelin_v1.3.0] (latest OZ commit merged is 8e01dd14f9211239213ae7bd4c6af92dd18d4ab7 from 24.10.2017).

* SRN token is a **SmartToken**, implementing Bancor's SmartToken contract.
